# He6-CRES
Simulating the beta spectrum of He6

In this project we are focused on measuring the Friez term.


In the fitting.py this shows the generation of the beta spectrum for the Helium6 nuclei, as well the fitting to the data to extract the Friez,b term.

In response.py code show the sensitivity of the detector to the different beta enegies.

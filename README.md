# He6-CRES

Simulating the beta spectrum of He6

In this project we are focused on extracting the Fierz interference term, which in the following scripts is denoted as a lowercase b.


The final_fitting_He6.ipynb code shows the generation of the beta spectrum for the Helium6 nuclei, as well the fitting to the data to extract the Fierz interence term.


In Response_func_final.ipynb code show the sensitivity of the detector to the different beta enegies.

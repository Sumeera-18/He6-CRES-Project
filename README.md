# He6-CRES

Simulating the beta spectrum of He6

In this project we are focused on extracting the Fierz interference term, which in the following code it is denoted as by lowercase b.


In the fitting.py this shows the generation of the beta spectrum for the Helium6 nuclei, as well the fitting to the data to extract the Fierz interence term.


In response.py code show the sensitivity of the detector to the different beta enegies.
